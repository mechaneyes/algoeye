This site collects works under the Algorithmic Eye umbrella.

Two projects are currently in progress:

## Scopus Ex Machina

Scopus Ex Machina is a zine I'm producing to highlight the increasing power of the surveillance aparatus with sights currently trained on you and me.

## Scopeo

Scopeo is a roll-your-own facial recognition system that I'm building. The output of the project is undetermined at this time, but I'm doing the work to identify what that will be.
